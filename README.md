# vi
Vi is an implementation of statistical learning algorithms, but only using variational inference

### why
1.  I wanted to learn about variational inference and practice using pytorch (main reason),
2.  variational inference gives you bayesian inference quickly since it is an optimisation (a quadratic one with the right distribution prior),
3.  it has a cool ass name.
